# NotesIndexer
Creating a book-like index for your pptx notes so they're easy to find during open book exams (that was my motivation at least)

## Results So-far
As of now, it works minimally with my PowerPoint notes. So the output txt file is a sorted index of all the words and their corresponding slides, except specifically excluded words and characters.
That's kind of the problem. So i have a lot of numbers and semi-links etc that are unnecessarily there. It's not a major issue cause you can just gloss over it when looking for a specific word.
But it's too many words still and so I'mma see if there is any way to resolve that.
